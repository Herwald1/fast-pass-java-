Fastpass is a last pass alternative that was inspired by Mr.Humes(the lead dev)
when he was locked out of his last pass account

Fastpass aims to develope a password management system that is localized on the 
users device.

All passwords that are stored on a user account are encryped and only that 
user's account will be able to access the stored password

The encryption is based on a unique key that is randomly generated when a new 
user is created.(this key will only be accessed by the application when the user is creating 
  a new password save or when requesting to view saved passwords)
